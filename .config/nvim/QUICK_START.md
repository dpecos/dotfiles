### Step 2: Test New Features (Recommended)

#### Test Commenting:
```vim
" Open any file and try:
gcc          " Toggle comment on current line
gc2j         " Comment current line + 2 below
gcip         " Comment paragraph
```

#### Test Surround:
```vim
" Place cursor on a word:
ysiw"        " Surround word with quotes ‚Üí "word"
ds"          " Remove quotes ‚Üí word
cs"'         " Change " to ' ‚Üí 'word'
yss)         " Surround line with () 
```

#### Test Which-Key:
```vim
" Press leader and wait ~300ms:
<leader>     " Shows popup with all available commands
g            " Shows all goto commands
[            " Shows all previous commands
]            " Shows all next commands
```

#### Test Better UI:
```vim
" In a code file with LSP:
gra          " Code actions - should show Telescope picker
grn          " Rename - should show better input dialog
```

---

### Step 3: Check Health (Recommended)

```vim
:checkhealth
```

Look for any warnings or errors. Most should be green ‚úÖ.

---

### Step 4: Verify LSP (Optional)

```vim
:LspInfo
```

Should show attached LSP servers for your file type.
