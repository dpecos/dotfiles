# Organize Imports Fix - Summary

## What Was Fixed

Fixed errors when organizing TypeScript/JavaScript imports, both manually and automatically on save.

## Changes Made

### 1. `lua/plugins/typescript-tools.lua`
- Added `get_ts_ls_client()` helper to verify LSP client is attached
- Updated `organize_imports()` to use `client.request()` instead of `vim.lsp.buf.execute_command()`
- Updated `sort_imports()` with same improvements
- Added proper error handling with user notifications

### 2. `lua/plugins/lsp.lua`
- Updated auto-organize-on-save to check for ts_ls client before executing
- Changed from `pcall()` + arbitrary delay to proper async callback
- Added fallback to format-only if ts_ls not attached
- Format with Biome happens in callback after organize completes (100ms delay)

## Key Improvements

✅ Proper LSP client verification before executing commands
✅ Better error handling with clear notifications  
✅ Async callback-based flow (not arbitrary delays)
✅ Graceful degradation if LSP not attached
✅ More reliable import organization

## How to Use

### Manual Commands (TS/JS files only)
- `<leader>oi` - Organize imports (sort + remove unused)
- `<leader>os` - Sort imports
- `<leader>ou` - Remove unused imports
- `<leader>oa` - Add missing imports
- `<leader>of` - Fix all fixable errors

### Automatic on Save
For TypeScript/JavaScript files, saving automatically:
1. Organizes imports (if ts_ls attached)
2. Formats with Biome

## Testing

To verify the fix works:
1. Open a TypeScript file
2. Add some duplicate or unused imports
3. Use `<leader>oi` to manually organize
4. Save the file to test auto-organize

## Technical Details

- Uses native Neovim 0.11+ LSP API
- No external plugins needed (typescript-tools.nvim was already removed)
- Works with `ts_ls` (typescript-language-server)
- Biome handles formatting, ts_ls handles import organization
