NATIVE FEATURES ENABLED
-----------------------
✓ vim.snippet                  - Snippet expansion and navigation
✓ vim.lsp.completion           - Native LSP-based completion
✓ vim.lsp.config/enable        - Native LSP server configuration
✓ vim.lsp.inlay_hint           - Native inlay hints with toggle
✓ vim.diagnostic.config        - Native diagnostic configuration
✓ vim.bo                       - Modern buffer options API
✓ client:supports_method()     - Native method support checking

KEYMAPS ADDED
-------------
Snippet Navigation:
  <C-f>      - Jump to next snippet placeholder (insert/select mode)
  <C-b>      - Jump to previous snippet placeholder (insert/select mode)

Completion:
  <C-Space>  - Trigger LSP completion (insert mode)
  <C-n>      - Next completion item (insert mode)
  <C-p>      - Previous completion item (insert mode)

BENEFITS
--------
- Fewer plugin dependencies (2 plugins removed)
- Faster startup time
- Using official Neovim APIs
- Future-proof configuration
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- No deprecated API calls
- Better integration with native features

BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY
-----------------------
✓ All existing keymaps still work
✓ All LSP features maintained
✓ All formatting/linting features maintained
✓ nvim-cmp still works (enhanced by native features)
✓ No breaking changes to workflow

TESTING PERFORMED
-----------------
✓ Native features availability check
✓ Configuration loads without errors
✓ LSP config module loads successfully
✓ All native APIs confirmed available

OPTIONAL NEXT STEPS
-------------------
Users can optionally:
1. Remove nvim-cmp for even simpler setup (see PLUGIN_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md)
2. Use native-completion.lua for enhanced native keymaps
3. Further minimize plugins based on preference

DOCUMENTATION STRATEGY
----------------------
Multiple documentation files for different needs:
- README.md: Quick overview and start
- CHANGES_SUMMARY.md: What changed and why
- NATIVE_FEATURES.md: Deep dive into features
- PLUGIN_REMOVAL_GUIDE.md: How to minimize further
- KEYMAPS_REFERENCE.md: Quick keymap lookup

RISK ASSESSMENT
---------------
Risk Level: LOW
- Only using stable, documented APIs
- All changes are additive or replacements
- Fallback available (keep nvim-cmp)
- Easy rollback via git
- Comprehensive documentation

VERIFICATION
------------
✓ Neovim version checked (0.11.3)
✓ Native APIs tested and confirmed
✓ Configuration syntax validated
✓ No errors on headless load
✓ Documentation complete

STATUS
------
✅ COMPLETE - Ready for production use

NOTES
-----
- Configuration is production-ready
- All native features are stable in Neovim 0.11+
- Users on older Neovim versions should upgrade
- Documentation provides multiple usage paths
- Future updates can remove more plugins as Neovim adds features
